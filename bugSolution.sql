The error can be solved in several ways. Here are two common approaches:

**Method 1: Repeating the aggregate function:**

This method directly replaces the alias with the entire aggregate calculation within the outer query:

```sql
SELECT dept_name, AVG(AVG(salary)) AS average_dept_salary
FROM (SELECT department, salary FROM employees) AS EmployeeSalaries
GROUP BY dept_name;
```

**Method 2: Using a Common Table Expression (CTE):**

This approach improves readability and maintainability by creating a CTE for the inner query:

```sql
WITH DepartmentAvgSalaries AS (
    SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department
)
SELECT das.department as dept_name, AVG(das.average_salary) AS average_dept_salary
FROM DepartmentAvgSalaries das
GROUP BY das.department;
```

The CTE makes the query more modular and easier to understand.  Choose the method that best suits your specific database system and coding style.  Method 2, using a CTE, is generally preferred for clarity.
